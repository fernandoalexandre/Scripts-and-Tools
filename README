Image Organize (Python) -
Organizes Images by resolutions. The way to define which resolutions
to sort is done by creating the folders previously with the name "width[sep]height" (sep can be redefined in the script itself) the ones that do not fit these parameters will get sorted to the folder "unsorted".

Example of usage:
% python WallpaperOrganize.py ~/Desktop/Wallpapers

Will transfer all the images by resolutions from ~/Desktop/Wallpapers to ~/Pictures/Wallpapers.
