Image Organize (Python) -

Organizes Images by resolutions. The way to define which resolutions
to sort is done by creating the folders previously with the name "width[sep]height" (by default sep = 'x') the ones that do not fit these resolutions will be sorted to "unsorted" folder (is automatically created if it doesn't exist).

Example of usage:
% python WallpaperOrganize.py ~/Desktop/Wallpapers

Will transfer all the images by resolutions from ~/Desktop/Wallpapers to ~/Pictures/Wallpapers.
